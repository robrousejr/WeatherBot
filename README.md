# WeatherBot
HAkron 2.0 Project for Hackathon

# Main.py
This file is all of the Python coding which is going to get the weather information from the Weather API. It has some conversions from
Kelvin to Fahrenheit and also has some other coding which makes everything just 2 decimal places and not long floats 

# sketch_sep24a.ino
This file is the code for the Arduino to run everything. 

# What Else Do I Need?
If you want to run this hack, you need to have:
* 8x8 LED
* 16x2 LCD
* Breadboard
* Arduino Mega
* Jumper Wires
* Potentiometer
(Getting a kit will come with everything!)
