# WeatherBot
HAkron 2.0 Project for Hackathon    
**Description:** WeatherBot uses Python to extract weather data from the *OpenWeatherMap* API and relays the information to an Arduino which is connected to small LCD screens which display the weather and animations of the weather to go along with it. You can enter any city name and it will output the city name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

# Main.py
This file is all of the Python coding which is going to get the weather information from the Weather API. It has some conversions from
Kelvin to Fahrenheit and also has some other coding which makes everything just 2 decimal places and not long floats

# sketch_sep24a.ino
This file is the code for the Arduino to run everything.

# What Else Do I Need?
If you want to run this hack, you need to have:
* 8x8 LED
* 16x2 LCD
* Breadboard
* Arduino Mega
* Jumper Wires
* Potentiometer
(Getting a kit will come with everything!)

# Final Words
Thank you everyone! If you have any questions, please get in touch!
